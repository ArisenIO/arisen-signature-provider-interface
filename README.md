# ARISEN Signature Provider Interface

An abstract class that implements the [ARISEN Signature Provider interface](https://github.com/ARISEN/@arisencore/js/blob/68272dd4a52f6fca51a4ff668d3800eafe5a19e4/src/@arisencore/js-api-interfaces.ts#L61), and provides helper methods for interacting with an authenticator using the [ARISEN Authentication Transport Protocol Specification](https://github.com/ARISEN/arisen-authentication-transport-protocol-spec).

## About ARISEN Labs

ARISEN Labs repositories are experimental.  Developers in the community are encouraged to use ARISEN Labs repositories as the basis for code and concepts to incorporate into their applications. Community members are also welcome to contribute and further develop these repositories. Since these repositories are not supported by Block.one, we may not provide responses to issue reports, pull requests, updates to functionality, or other requests from the community, and we encourage the community to take responsibility for these.

## Overview

This base class handles creating the request envelopes with the expected data structure specified by the ARISEN Authentication Transport Protocol Specification. Concrete implementations can then create specific SignatureProviders for different platforms and environments by implementing the transport method used. These SignatureProviders can then be plugged into `@arisencore/js` to enable communicating with an external authenticator. Full instructions for `@arisencore/js` can be found [here](https://github.com/ARISEN/@arisencore/js).

## Installation

```bash
yarn add arisen-spi
```

## Usage

### Example Concrete Implementation

The following rough example uses deep linking as the transport method:

```javascript
import {
  SignatureProviderInterface,
  SignatureProviderInterfaceParams,
  SignatureProviderRequestEnvelope,
  instanceOfResponseEnvelope,
  packEnvelope,
  unpackEnvelope,
} from 'arisen-spi'

export class SignatureProvider extends SignatureProviderInterface {
  private cachedKeys: string[]

  constructor(params: SignatureProviderInterfaceParams) {
    super(params)
    window.onhashchange = this.onWindowHashChange
  }

  /**
   * An abstract method to be implemented by a subclass.
   * Here is where you send off a request on your transport method of choice.
   * This is a quick and dirty example of deep linking.
   */
  protected sendRequest(requestEnvelope: SignatureProviderRequestEnvelope): void {
    const packedRequestEnvelope = packEnvelope(requestEnvelope)
    const url = `example://request?payload=${packedRequestEnvelope}`
    window.open(url, 'system')
  }

  /**
   * An abstract method to be implemented by a subclass.
   * The base class will call this method to look for cached keys before calling `sendRequest`.
   * Return an empty array, null, or undefined if caching is not desired.
   */
  protected getCachedKeys(): string[] {
    return this.cachedKeys
  }

  /**
   * An abstract method to be implemented by a subclass.
   * The base class will call this method when it wants to cache keys.
   * Implement as a noop if caching is not desired.
   */
  protected setCachedKeys(keys: string[]): void {
    this.cachedKeys = keys
  }

  /**
   * An abstract method to be implemented by a subclass.
   * The base class will call this method when it wants to clear out cached keys.
   * Implement as a noop if caching is not desired.
   */
  public clearCachedKeys(): void {
    this.cachedKeys = null
  }

  private onWindowHashChange = () => {
    const response = window.location.hash.replace('#', '')
    const responseEnvelope = unpackEnvelope(response)

    if (!instanceOfResponseEnvelope(responseEnvelope)) { return }

    /**
     * `handleResponse` is implemented by the base class.
     * Call it to finish a pending request
     */
    this.handleResponse(responseEnvelope)
  }
}
```
